AirBnB clone - The console

üìù Description

This is our first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what we built during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration‚Ä¶. This AirBnB clone project works with a console that uses the cmd python module. This project was built with OOP so you can create, show, all, update, destroy BaseModels, places or Cities objects among others.
